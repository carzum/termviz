# TermViz - ROS visualization on the terminal

TermViz is a visualizer for the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, that runs completely on the terminal.
This allows the visualizer to run directly on the robot (e.g., via ssh) without any configuration on an external computer. Additionally, it is lightweight and really fast to start and to quit.
It can also be useful in case the robot has a firewall or in situations in which no graphics server can be run.
## Supported message types

- geometry_msgs::PoseArray
- geometry_msgs::PoseStamped
- nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid
- nav_msgs::Path
- sensor_msgs::Image
- sensor_msgs::LaserScan
- sensor_msgs::PointCloud2
- visualization_msgs::Marker
- visualization_msgs::MarkerArray

## Installation

Get the source code:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:carzum/termviz.git
```

Build the project via cargo:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

After the build succeeded, the executable will be located in `target/release/` and can be used directly. No external libraries are needed, so it can be copied directly on a robot or another computer.

## How to use

To launch the visualizer, just run the `termviz` executable.

The program looks for a configuration file named `termviz.yml` in `~/.config/termviz/` first, then in `/etc/termviz/`. If the file is not found, it prompts the user to create a default one. Alternatively, it is possible to pass a configuration file directly to the executable: `termviz <myconfig>.yml`.

The program requires a running ROS master and an available TF between the robot frame (`base_link` by default) and a static frame (`map` by default). If the ROS parameter `/footprint`, it will be used to show the footprint of the robot.

Pressing `h` shows the help screen, which will describe the current mode and the keymap relative to the current mode. The mode can be switched using the number keys and the help screen will update accordingly.

### Send pose mode

The mode allows to publish a `geometry_msgs::PoseWithCovarianceStamped` message on a topic. The desired pose can be selected by moving the outline of the robot in the map. Confirming the operation (`Enter` by default) publishes the pose on the topic specified under `send_pose_topic` in the configuration file.

### Teleoperate mode

The mode allows to teleoperate the robot by sending `geometry_msgs::Twist` messages on the specified topic (`cmd_vel` by default). The messages are continuosly sent. Any unmapped key switches the sent messages to 0, i.e., stops the robot.
Settings can be found under `teleop` in the configuration file.

### Image mode

This mode allows to visualize images received on the topics specified under `image_topics` in the configuration file.
