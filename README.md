# TermViz - ROS visualization on the terminal

![Animation](images/usage.gif)

TermViz is a visualizer for the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, that runs completely on the terminal.
This allows the visualizer to run directly on the robot (e.g., via ssh) without any configuration on an external computer. Additionally, it is lightweight and really fast to start and to quit.
It can also be useful in case the robot has a firewall or in situations in which no graphics server can be run.
## Supported message types

- geometry_msgs::PoseArray
- geometry_msgs::PoseStamped
- nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid
- nav_msgs::Path
- sensor_msgs::Image
- sensor_msgs::LaserScan
- sensor_msgs::PointCloud2
- visualization_msgs::Marker
- visualization_msgs::MarkerArray

## Installation

Get the source code:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:carzum/termviz.git
```

Build the project via cargo:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

After the build succeeded, the executable will be located in `target/release/` and can be used directly. No external libraries are needed, so it can be copied directly on a robot or another computer.

## How to use

To launch the visualizer, just run the `termviz` executable.

The program looks for a configuration file named `termviz.yml` in `~/.config/termviz/` first, then in `/etc/termviz/`. If the file is not found, it prompts the user to create a default one. Alternatively, it is possible to pass a configuration file directly to the executable: `termviz <myconfig>.yml`.

The program requires a running ROS master and an available TF between the robot frame (`base_link` by default) and a static frame (`map` by default). If the ROS parameter `/footprint`, it will be used to show the footprint of the robot.

Pressing `h` shows the help screen, which will describe the current mode and the keymap relative to the current mode. The mode can be switched using the number keys and the help screen will update accordingly.

### Send pose mode

The mode allows to publish a pose message on a topic, for example to send an initial pose estimate to a localization system or a goal pose for the navigation stack. The supported types are `geometry_msgs::Pose`, `geometry_msgs::PoseStamped`, and `geometry_msgs::PoseWithCovarianceStamped`. The desired pose can be selected by moving the outline of the robot in the map. Confirming the operation (`Enter` by default) publishes the pose on the selected topic among those specified under `send_pose_topics` in the configuration file. The target topic can be selected using the "next" and "previous" keys (`n` and `b` by default).

### Teleoperate mode

The mode allows to teleoperate the robot by sending `geometry_msgs::Twist` messages on the specified topic (`cmd_vel` by default). The messages are continuously sent. Any unmapped key switches the sent messages to 0, i.e., stops the robot.
Settings can be found under `teleop` in the configuration file.

If the parameter 'publish_cmd_vel_when_idle' is set to true (default), the mode will keep publishing STOP (all velocities 0).
Otherwise the command is only sent once! This should allow users to teleoperate robots without blocking them actively

### Image mode

This mode allows to visualize images received on the topics specified under `image_topics` in the configuration file.

### Topic Manager

The topic manager can add and remove topics int the termviz config. When confirmed the config will be stored and termviz must be restarted.
Only supported topics are displayed, topics can only be in the active or in the available list.

### TF Tree View

Similar to rqt_tf_tree, it displays the TF tree and allows users to interactively echo any two arbitrary frames.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure the tf2_frames service is available by running the [tf_service server](https://github.com/magazino/tf_service) with the --frames_service argument:

```sh
rosrun tf_service server --frames_service
```
**Note**: tf service server is required since [rustros_tf](https://github.com/arjo129/rustros_tf) doesn't advertise by default tf2_frames service like C++/Python versions do.
